## Bayesian computations

- Over the past 30 years, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) methods have **revolutionized** Bayesian statistics.

- Bayesian computational statistics is nowadays a lively and mature research field, compared to the early days. Still, there are several open questions. 

> "Arguably the biggest challenge is in computation. If MCMC is no longer viable for the problems people want to address, then what is the role of INLA, of variational methods, of ABC approaches?" **Alan Gelfand** (ISBA bullettin, 2011)

## Bayesian inference (recap)

- Let $\bm{X}$ be the data, following some distribution $\pi(\bm{X} \mid \bm{\theta})$, i.e. the **likelihood**, with $\bm{\theta} \in \Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p$ being an unknown set of parameters. 

- Let $\pi(\bm{\theta})$ be the **prior distribution** associated to $\bm{\theta}$.

- In Bayesian analysis, inference is based on the **posterior distribution** for $\bm{\theta}$, defined as
$$
\pi(\bm{\theta} \mid \bm{X}) = \frac{\pi(\bm{\theta}) \pi(\bm{X} \mid \bm{\theta})}{\int_\Theta\pi(\bm{\theta}) \pi(\bm{X} \mid \bm{\theta}) \mathrm{d} \bm{\theta}}.
$$

- The **normalizing constant**, i.e. the above integral, is often **intractable** $\implies$ no analytical solutions, beyond conjugate cases.

- Numerical approximations of $\int_\Theta\pi(\bm{\theta}) \pi(\bm{X} \mid \bm{\theta}) \mathrm{d} \bm{\theta}$ are highly unstable, especially in high dimensions $\implies$ the `integrate` **R** function will not work in most cases.

## Bayesian inference using sampling

- It is sometimes possible to **sample** from the posterior distribution even without knowing the normalizing constant. 
- If we can get **random samples** $\bm{\theta}^{(1)}, \dots,\bm{\theta}^{(R)}$ from the posterior distribution, then we can approximate any functional of interest, i.e.
$$
\mathbb{E}(g(\bm{\theta}) \mid \bm{X}) \approx \frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^R g(\bm{\theta}^{(r)}).
$$

- If $\bm{\theta}^{(1)}, \dots,\bm{\theta}^{(R)}$ were **independent** samples from the posterior distribution, this approximation would be called **Monte Carlo integration**. 

- Monte Carlo integration is justified by the **law of large numbers**.

- In this course, we will consider samples $\bm{\theta}^{(1)}, \dots,\bm{\theta}^{(R)}$ that are **dependent** and follow a Markov Chain $\implies$ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

## Markov chains

- A sequence $\bm{Y}^{(0)}, \bm{Y}^{(1)}, \dots, \bm{Y}^{(R)}$ of random elements is a **Markov chain** if 
$$
\mathbb{P}(\bm{Y}^{(r + 1)} \in A \mid \bm{y}^{(0)}, \dots, \bm{y}^{(r)}) = \mathbb{P}(\bm{Y}^{(r + 1)} \in A \mid\bm{y}^{(r)}). 
$$

- In other words, the conditional distribution of $\bm{Y}^{(r + 1)}$ given $\bm{y}^{(0)}, \dots, \bm{y}^{(r)}$ is the same as the conditional distribution of $\bm{Y}^{(r + 1)}$ given $\bm{y}^{(r)}$, called **transition kernel**.

- Given an initial condition $\bm{y}^{(0)}$ a Markov chain is fully characterized by its transition kernel, which we assume does not depend on $r$ (**homogeneity**). 

- In continuous cases, the transition kernel is identified by a **conditional density**, denoted with
$$
k(\bm{y}^{(r+1)} \mid \bm{y}^{(r)}).
$$

- When the sample space is finite, the transition kernel is a **transition matrix**, say $P$.

## Example: AR(1)

- **Autoregressive** processes provide a simple illustration of **Markov chains** on continuous state-space.

- Let $Y^{(0)} \sim N(30, 1)$ and let us define
$$
Y^{(r)} = \rho Y^{(r-1)} + \epsilon^{(r)}, \qquad \rho \in \mathbb{R},
$$
with the error terms $\epsilon^{(r)}$ being iid according to a standard Gaussian $\text{N}(0,1)$. 

- Then the sequence of $Y^{(r)}$ forms indeed a Markov chain and the **transition density** is such that
$$
(y^{(r)} \mid y^{(r-1)})  \sim \text{N}(\rho y^{(r-1)}, 1).
$$ 

- If the parameter $|\rho| < 1$ then the Markov chain has a more "stable" behaviour. 

## Example: AR(1)

```{r}
#| echo: false
R <- 300

# Stationary process
set.seed(123)
rho <- 0.5
y_stat <- numeric(R + 1)
y_stat[1] <- rnorm(1, 30, 1)
for(r in 1:R){
    y_stat[r + 1] = rho * y_stat[r] + rnorm(1)
}

plot(y_stat, type = "l")
```

## Invariant distribution

- An increased level of stability of a Markov chain occurs when the latter admits an **invariant** or **stationary** probability distribution.

- A probability density $\pi(\bm{y})$ is invariant for a Markov chain with kernel $k$ if
$$
\pi(\bm{y}^*) = \int k(\bm{y}^* \mid \bm{y})\pi(\bm{y})\mathrm{d}\bm{y}.
$$

- This is to say that the **marginal** distributions of $\bm{Y}^{(r)}$ and  $\bm{Y}^{(r + 1)}$ are the same and are equal to $\pi(\bm{y})$, although $\bm{Y}^{(r)}$ and  $\bm{Y}^{(r + 1)}$ remain **dependent**.

- Roughly speaking, if a Markov chain admits a stationary distribution + some technical conditions, then for $R$ large enough the chain "stabilizes" around the invariant law.

- In the previous $\textup{ar}(1)$ example the stationary distribution is $\text{N}(0, 1 / (1 - \rho^2))$. 

## Invariant distribution

- Not every Markov chain admits a stationary law. However, the Markov chains constructed for sampling purposes should always converge to an invariant distribution.

- Indeed, in Markov Chain Monte Carlo the stationary distribution $\pi(\bm{y})$ represents the **target density** from which we wish to simulate. 

- Then, we will make use of the following approximation 
$$
\int g(\bm{y}) \pi(\bm{y})\mathrm{d}\bm{y} \approx \frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^R g(\bm{y}^{(r)}),
$$
where $\bm{y}^{(1)}, \dots, \bm{y}^{(R)}$ are generated according to a Markov chain, with $\bm{y}^{(0)} \sim \pi(\bm{y})$. 

- How to construct a Markov chain that converges to the desired density $\pi(\bm{y})$?

- Before delving into this key problem, let us briefly review the assumptions under which this approximation is a reasonable one. 


## Regularity conditions

- We will consider Markov chains that are **irreducible**, **aperiodic**, and **Harris recurrent**.

- A rigorous presen **discrete case** to help the intuition.

- For a more detailed treatment, see Chapter 6 of Robert and Casella (2004). 

- **Irreducibility**. The chain is irreducible if it does not "get stuck" in a local region of the sample space. In the discrete case the chain is irreducible if all states are connected. 

- **Aperiodicity**. The chain is aperiodic if it does not has any deterministic cycle.

- **Harris recurrent**. The chain is (Harris) recurrent if it visits any region of the sample space "sufficiently often".


## Irreducibility

- The aforementioned properties are easy to formalize in the **discrete** setting, namely when the values of the Markov chain are $Y^{(r)} \in \{1, 2,\dots\}$. 

- The **first passage time** is the first $r$ for which the chain is equal to $j$, namely:
$$
\tau_j = \inf\{r \ge 1 : Y^{(r)} = j\},
$$
where by convention we let $\tau_j = \infty$ if $Y^{(r)} \neq j$ for every $r \ge 1$. 
- Moreover, let us denote the **probability of return** to $j$ in a finite number of step, starting from $j'$
$$
\mathbb{P}(\tau_j < \infty \mid y^{(0)} = j').
$$
- Hence, the chain is **irreducible** if 
$\mathbb{P}(\tau_j < \infty \mid y^{(0)} = j') > 0$ for all $j, j' \in \mathbb{N}$.
